Circuit: PIC16F84A + HDSP-7401 7-Segment Display

>> Microcontroller (U2: PIC16F84A)
VDD (pin 14): +5V power input (DC), expected current: ~5-10 mA for MCU logic
VSS (pin 5): Ground
RA0–RA3 (pins 17–18): Not connected in schematic
RB0–RB7 (pins 6–13): Digital output signals to 7-segment displays, each line can sink/source ~10 mA depending on segment current

>> 7-Segment Displays (U1 & U3: HDSP-7401, Common Anode)
Pins A–G, DP (1–7, 9): Segment cathodes connected to PIC I/O lines (RBx), signal type: Digital Output
Expected current per segment: ~10 mA (DC) sink per active segment
Pin 10: Common Anode (CA), connected to +5V (constant high), provides current to all segments
Total display current (worst case): ~70 mA per display (all segments on)

>> Clock Circuit
Y1: 4 MHz Crystal Oscillator
C1, C2: 20 pF capacitors to ground (analog AC signals, near zero DC current)
OSC1/OSC2 (pins 15, 16): Oscillator input/output, signal type: Analog AC, ~5Vpp

>> MCLR Reset Circuit
Pin 4 (MCLR): Connected to +5V via 100Ω resistor (R1), digital high (weak pull-up), ~50 µA typical

>> Switches (SW3, SW4)
Connected between MCLR and GND, momentary input
Signal type: Digital logic (low when pressed), no continuous current (only pulldown)

>> Power and Ground
J1: 2-pin connector to +5V and GND input
PWR_FLAG: Logical marker in KiCad for power net

>> LED Indicator (Not shown in this schematic but common)
R2: 100Ω resistor connected to power net for indication (optional), assumed LED + R2 draws ~10–15 mA if present
